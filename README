		Dream engine
INTRODUCTION
[if you dont want to be bored start from the section ====ARCHITECTURE====]
My name is... who cares))) The main idea is that here i will tell about my engine architecure
Wryting an engyne is my deream of childhood. Since i was 23 years old - that long long time 
ago when i was sadying in RWTH univercity, i was dreaming about wryting my own engine. All this
sought about engine architectures, different functionality modules and communication subsystems 
between them made my wet programming dreams about writing some hardcore system more and more wetter. 
In this document i will make some notes  about the architecture and features my future engine. 
If you will find some mistakes in the text or some weard statements about game enjines... Just skip it)
However if you would like to contribute to this project - i will be wery happy to read your comments! 
Enjoy the reading)))
